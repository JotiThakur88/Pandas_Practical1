# Pandas_Practical1
This project creates a synthetic dataset with ages, incomes, and scores, performs statistical analysis (mean, median, weighted mean, z-scores, outliers, age bins), and demonstrates NumPy operations like array manipulation, broadcasting, dot products, and matrix algebra.
# Synthetic Data & Operations Project

##  Overview
This project demonstrates how to generate synthetic data and perform key data analysis and numerical operations using **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Pandas**.  
It covers descriptive statistics, standardization, grouping, and array/matrix operations.
##  Features
1. **Synthetic Dataset Creation**
   - Generates IDs, ages, incomes (lognormal), and scores (normal).
   - Includes random **NaN values** to simulate missing data.

2. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Mean, median, and age-weighted mean of income.
   - Explanation of when weighted mean is useful.

3. **Standardization & Outlier Detection**
   - Z-score transformation of income.
   - Identifies outliers where |z| > 3.

4. **Grouped Analysis**
   - Bins ages into ranges: [18–25), [25–35), [35–45), [45–60).
   - Aggregates count, mean income, and median score by group.

5. **NumPy Array Operations**
   - Shape, size, transpose, flattening.
   - Negative indexing and error handling.
   - Broadcasting with row vectors.
   - Dot product with another matrix.
   - Determinant and inverse of a matrix.
